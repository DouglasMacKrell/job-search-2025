*Note: This skill often distinguishes Engineers from Senior Engineers.*

### 1. Be Proactive
- Set clear expectations within your team
  - Address logistics early
  - Clarify code specifics
  - Remove ambiguity BEFORE starting work
- Think ahead and anticipate questions/concerns

### 2. Stay Constructive
- Focus on productive code review comments
  - Frame issues as questions rather than criticisms
  - Provide context for your concerns
  - Suggest specific improvements

### 3. Choose Communication Methods Wisely
#### Live Communication
- Best for:
  - Paired programming sessions
  - Complex explanations requiring nuance
  - Avoiding lengthy text exchanges

#### Asynchronous Communication
- Handles most day-to-day interactions
- Good for:
  - Documentation
  - Code reviews
  - Status updates

### Best Practices
- Follow your team's established communication patterns
- Keep messages clear and concise
- Choose the right medium for the message
- Document important decisions and discussions

[Reference: Stack Overflow Blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/30/how-to-make-good-code-reviews-better/)

### Areas to Cover in Review
- Look at the change itself and its fit in the codebase
  - Title and description clarity
  - Code correctness
  - Test coverage
  - Functionality changes
  - Coding guidelines compliance
- Consider the broader system context
  - Impact on other system parts
  - Maintainability concerns
  - Architectural fit
  - Potential simplifications

### Communication Tone
- Maintain a professional and positive tone
  - Ask open-ended questions instead of making statements
  - Offer alternatives without insisting they're the only way
  - Be empathetic to the author's effort
  - Celebrate good solutions

### Review Status Guidelines
- Be explicit about approval or changes needed
  - Don't approve while open questions remain
  - Clearly mark non-blocking comments
  - Use team conventions for approval (e.g., "LGTM" or üëç)
- Be flexible when appropriate
  - Consider follow-up tickets for non-critical changes
  - Accommodate urgency when needed

### When to Move Beyond Written Reviews
- Switch to face-to-face communication when:
  - Discussion becomes a long back-and-forth
  - Many comments indicate potential misunderstanding
  - Complex changes need detailed explanation
- Proactively reach out after first review pass if needed

### Handling Nitpicks
- Clearly mark minor suggestions with "nit:"
- Avoid overwhelming the review with trivial comments
- Consider automating common nitpicks through:
  - Linting tools
  - Team coding standards
  - Automated checks

### Special Considerations
#### For New Team Members
- Maintain quality standards while being extra supportive
- Provide additional context and documentation links
- Celebrate first contributions
- Be more detailed in explanations

#### For Cross-Time Zone Collaboration
- Review during overlapping work hours when possible
- Offer video calls for complex discussions
- Consider systemic solutions for frequent cross-zone dependencies
  - Service ownership adjustments
  - Interface improvements
  - Documentation updates

### Organizational Support
- Ensure all engineers participate in reviews
- Include review work in job expectations
- Invest in review tooling and efficiency
- Support initiatives to improve review processes
- Address hostile or unhelpful review patterns
- Maintain strict "no code to production without review" policies

### Key Takeaways
- Reviews are crucial for code quality and team growth
- Balance thoroughness with efficiency
- Focus on both technical and communication aspects
- Continuously improve review processes
- Invest in tooling and standards
- Foster a positive review culture
