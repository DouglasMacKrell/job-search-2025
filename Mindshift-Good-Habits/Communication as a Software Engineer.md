[LINK](https://youtu.be/ofk6vLZ3hPw?si=bYR_sfvTuIs18P6b)
1. Know your audience
  - Know who you are communicating with
    - Don't use technical jargon when talking with non tech roles
    - Don't assume knowledge
    - Talior to the individual, don't go into the weeds
2. It's better to overcommunicate than undercommunicate
  - Don't leave things ambiguios or up to interpretation
  - Repetition is not a bad thing
    - Summarize in conclusion to help those who zoned out
3. Structure
  - You want to make sure that communication is structured
    - thesis => body => conclusion
    - introduction, numbered list, 
  - Question in meeting:
    - How could a reader with less context understand
  - PR comment
    - There's a problem with this peice of code
    - Explanation
    - Suggestion/Constructive feedback
4. Intonation
  - Find how to leverage intonation to help get your thoughts across

This can be what separates Engineers from Senior Engineers.
1. Proactive
  - Setting expectations within your team
    - Logistics
    - Code specfics
    - Clarifying BEFORE you start (Remove ambeguity)
  - Think ahead
2. Constructive
  - Mostly within MR comments
    - Ask questions rather than bluntly pointing out problems
    - PERSONAL NOTE: This feels rather passive agressive
3. Asynchronous Vs Live
  - Live has benifits with
    - Paired programming
    - Explaining complicated things with nuance
      - saves from back and forth over text
  - Async 
    - Covers the breadth of all other conversations
Just keep it simple and follow the best practices of your company/team
